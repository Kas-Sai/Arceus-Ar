        <h2 class="sub-heading">India’s Own Moonland</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Stunning Gompas (Tibetan Buddhist monasteries), fluttering prayer flags, whitewashed stupas, Ladakh is a riot of intricate murals and red-robed monks. Dominated by dramatic landscapes, Ladakh is known as the world’s coldest desert.  It is said that only in Ladakh can a man sitting in the sun with his feet in the shade suffer from sunstroke and frostbite at the same time. With a culture similar to Tibetan culture, the people of Ladakh are friendly and welcoming to tourists.

        </p>
        <p class="post-text"> Ladakh is an adventure playground for climbing, jeeps tours, rafting and high-altitude trekking. Note that Leh Ladakh is inaccessible by road outside the summer months. The road passes close altogether from around October to May, and the only way to reach left is by air.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Land of High Passes</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Ladakh, also known as the “Land of High Passes,” is a region in the northernmost part of India that shares its borders with Pakistan, Tibet, and China. Ladakh is known for its picturesque landscapes, high-altitude mountain passes, and the unique culture of its people. But what many people don’t know is that Ladakh is also home to India’s very own “Moonland.”
        </p>
         <p class="post-text">One of the most unique features of Moonland is its soil, which is rich in minerals like magnesium, potassium, and calcium. The soil is so brittle that it breaks off easily, giving the landscape a surreal, otherworldly appearance. The erosion caused by wind and water over millions of years has resulted in the formation of deep gorges and ravines, making Moonland a haven for adventure seekers and hikers.</p>
