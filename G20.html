        <h2 class="sub-heading">G20 Summit 2023 Outcome’s: Delhi Declaration</h2>
        <p class="post-text">The G20 Summit 2023 Delhi Declaration is the 18th Meeting of the G20 Group in India which is the President country of this summit. You should know that this meeting holds a special place for the South East Countries because the leaders in this organization work for financial and strategic growth. </p>
         <h3>G20 Summit 2023 Outcome</h3>

           2. Secondly, New Delhi Leaders Declaration has been signed by the country heads as per which Inclusive Growth will be emphasised.

        <h2 class="sub-heading">What has India achieved in its G20 presidency?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">New Delhi: India’s presidency of G20 or the Group of 20 has been able to bring all member countries to the table on the issue of war in Ukraine and brought to the fore the voice of the emerging markets as moderators, said foreign policy experts, highlighting the country's heritage as the voice of reason.
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">The New Delhi Declaration issued on the first day of the two-day G20 Summit set the direction of future negotiations on important economic issues including climate financing which has for the first time put $5.9 trillion number to the green financing requirements for developing countries, reforms in multilateral banks, international taxation and sustainable development.</p>
         <p class="post-text">“People were expecting the declaration not to come out and that the paragraph of Ukraine would have been opposed by China and Russia, but the fact that everyone decided on a little give and take, is as much a tribute to diplomacy of India, as also India's ability to have chosen right. Emerging countries have got a role in terms of being the moderating influence, and this is not the first time that India has been a moderating influence," said Rajiv Dogra, former ambassador of India to Italy, Romania, Moldova, Albania and San Marino and India’s permanent representative to the United Nations agencies based in Rome.</p>
         <p class="post-text">On the Russia-Ukraine crisis, India worked very closely with Brazil, South Africa and Indonesia, where the emerging markets played a very key role, India’s Sherpa to the G20 Amitabh Kant said on Saturday, after issuing the joint communique. The declaration also noted the contribution of Turkiye and the UN-brokered Istanbul Agreements for the effective implementation of the Black Sea grain deal for ensuring immediate and unimpeded deliveries of grain, foodstuffs, and fertilizers/inputs from the Russian Federation and Ukraine.</p>
         <p class="post-text">“The most complex part of the entire #G20 was to bring consensus on the geopolitical paras (Russia-Ukraine). This was done over 200 hours of non-stop negotiations, 300 bilateral meetings, 15 drafts," Kant said in a social media post on Sunday.</p>
         <p class="post-text">The communique also included the African Union as a permanent member of the G20 and noted that the continent played an important role in the global economy. Vincent Magwenya, spokesperson to the President of South Africa told Mint on the sidelines that India’s role in the inclusion of the Global South in the Summit has set the benchmark for future discussions by any and all multilateral platforms, where the voice of the developing and underdeveloped countries would have a permanent platform.</p>
