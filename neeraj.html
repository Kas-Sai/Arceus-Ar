            Newly-crowned world champion Neeraj Chopra</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Newly-crowned world champion Neeraj Chopra was not at his best but still finished second
            with a final round throw of 85.71m in the men's javelin event of the Diamond League Meeting in Zurich on
            Thursday. </p>
        <p class="post-text"> The 25-year-old Chopra, also the reigning Olympic champion, produced three legal throws of
            80.79m, 85.22m and 85.71m while the remaining three were fouls. He finished behind Jakub Vadlejch (85.86m)
            of Czech Republic, who had won a bronze in the World Championships.</p>
        <p class="post-text">He had won the Diamond League Meetings in Doha (May 5) and Lausanne (June 30) â€” his only
            two competitions before winning a historic gold in the World Championships in Budapest on Sunday with a
            throw of 88.17m.
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">During the pre-event press conference here, Chopra had said that he was feeling a bit of
            pain on his shoulder and back after winning gold in the World Championships. He was not 100% fit during the
            showpiece event due to a groin strain he had sustained while training in May-June.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Chopra began with a modest 80.79m which put him in the second spot but he fouled the next
            two throws to slip to fifth at the halfway stage when Germany's Julian Weber was leading.</p>
        <p class="post-text">But Chopra pulled off 85.22m in his fourth attempt which saw him rise to second. By that
            time, Vadlejch had taken the lead.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Chopra fouled his fifth throw again bit achieved his best of the day -- 85.71m -- in his
            last throw.</p>
