        <h2 class="sub-heading">Design and display</h2>
        <p class="post-text">The Nothing Phone 2 builds on its predecessor's design. And that's not bad since the Phone
            1 had a distinct design. You get a transparent back with the Glyph interface that has also been enhanced.
            Besides the slight layout tweak, you can individually control more Glyph lights than before, and the rear
            glass panel slightly curves at the edges to meet the flat aluminum chassis. </p>
        <p class="post-text"> Unlike the Phone 1, which was available in white and black, the Phone 2 comes in gray and
            black. The plates at the rear are gray instead of white, giving the phone a smoky and more attractive look.
            While the Phone 2 builds on its predecessor's IP53 rating, it doesn't take a big enough leap. The phone is
            only IP54 certified, making it splashproof. This is unlike the best Android phones, almost all of which
            carry an IP68 rating.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Apart from the minor design changes, the biggest difference between Phone 1 and Phone 2 is
            size. The latter houses a bigger 6.7-inch panel, leading to a substantial jump in size compared with the
            Phone 1's 6.55-inch display. As for the 120Hz OLED screen, it's a good panel with vibrant colors, good
            viewing angles, and FHD+ resolution. Nothing claims it has a peak brightness of 1,600 nits. It's protected
            by Corning's Gorilla Glass 5, but Nothing preinstalls a screen protector for additional safety. The optical
            fingerprint scanner is a tad lower than we'd like, but it works fine.
