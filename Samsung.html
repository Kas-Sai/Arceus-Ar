        <h2 class="sub-heading">Design</h2>
        <p class="post-text">
            We tested the Green variant of Galaxy S23 Ultra that looks both sober and premium. It gets a matte-type finish that makes it easy to hold the phone. The rear side refracts light and gives it a sense of grey-ish shade. It doesn’t get finger imprints on it. </p>
        <p class="post-text"> The left frame of the device is plain while the right has the power and volume keys. The bottom houses the S-Pen, speaker grille, Type-C port, and the SIM tray. Samsung continues the centrally-placed punch hole display in the Galaxy S23 Ultra and didn’t try to visit any ‘island’. The display is curved towards the either side of the frame.</p>
         <p class="post-text">The Galaxy S23 Ultra does not feel heavy in hands as the weight distribution is uniform. The phone doesn’t generate heat either while charging. The in-display fingerprint scanner is quick but takes time to read if there’s moisture on the tips.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Display</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Samsung has used a 6.8-inch OLED display in the Galaxy S23 Ultra. The tallest form factor serves many purposes with the S-Pen and helps people like us prepare notes more easily. The display provides ample space to jostle down the important points in a press brief, and yes of course, the S-Pen is more refined, fast and accurate than the last generations.
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">Galaxy S23 Ultra’s display hits 1,750 nits of peak brightness which is amazing even under the direct gaze of the sun. Never has been an occasion that we missed any detail on this phone.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Processor</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Samsung has used the same processor in entire Galaxy S23 series which is Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. The peak performing processor has all the elements of being the pinnacle in Android for the moment. Although the same processor is being used in OnePlus 11 5G, Samsung markets it as ‘custom made for Galaxy’.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Rarely the phone shows any sign of slowing down. The game play has been fluent as well with even graphics intensive games ran smoothly on the Galaxy S23 Ultra. Long-term gaming does produce heat, but the SoC cools it down quickly with the help of the heat dissipation mechanism it has.</p>
        <p class="post-text">The Galaxy S23 Ultra ships with 12GB RAM and our unit holds 256GB internal space. Even though the phone is a 200MP shooter, but by default, it clicks in 12MP which goes on occupying a minimum of 3MB to 6MB average space on the phone. It’s sufficient to store games, apps locally on the phone and for photos we have cloud options as well.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Cameras</h2>
        <p class="post-text">This is where the entire focus of Galaxy S23 Ultra is. Samsung has tried balancing the phone by upgrading the main sensor to 200MP and simultaneously downgrading the selfie lens from 40MP to a standard 12MP across the new series.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Samsung has packed the Galaxy S23 Ultra with quad lenses at the back. A 200MP main lens with f/1.7, a 12MP ultrawide sensor, a 10MP telephoto shooter and a 10MP periscope lens with 10x optical zoom.</p>
